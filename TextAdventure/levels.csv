"intro","Welcome to Into The Light - a text adventure by Jonas Diete",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"level1","After a long, hard journey you emerge from the dark place that has been your home for your entire life. Your body aches from the effort and you wish you could have stayed longer in your cosy, warm home. But you know there is no way back. Terrified of the new life that awaits you, you decided to close your eyes for the last part of the journey and haven't yet dared to open them again. Now there is a calm settling in your body. It's over. You have arrived.","open eyes;open my eyes;open your eyes","You open your eyes. Everything is bright, bright light! An incredible sensation overcomes you - you feel more alive than ever before! However, the light is so bright that you can't really make out anything. For now you will have to rely on your other senses.","none","none",,,"say hello;say something;say help","You open your mouth and try to shout but you can just emit a strange scream. Then you hear familiar voices. Voices you have known your whole life. You can't quite make out what they say or where they come from, but they give you confidence. You suddenly feel very tired.","none","none",,,"sleep;go to sleep;close eyes;go to bed","The surface on which you lie is soft and feels very comfortable. You fall asleep just where you are.","load","level2","open eyes","Although you feel very tired, you think it would be interesting to look around first.","look around","You cannot make out much - the light is too bright and your eyes don't seem to be able to adjust yet.","none","none","open eyes","Your eyes are still closed.","listen;hear","You listen carefully. There is some calm humming in the air. In the background you can hear some indistinct chatter. It almost sounds like voices, but you can't understand what they are saying.","none","none",,,"feel;feel with hands;touch ground;touch things","You are lying on some sort of soft ground. It feels quite comfortable. You touch it with your hands and sense a wooly fabric, maybe even a bed. You are covered by a what seems to be a thin blanket.","none","none",,,"smell","You take a deep breath through your nose. There are lots of intense smells all mixed together. Some loevely and sweet, some slightly sickly, some horridly chemical and some fresh and flowery. You don't think you have ever smelled so many things at a time. It feels quite overwhelming and you feel tired.","none","none",,,"get up;stand up","Your legs are too weak to get up. You also feel quite tired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"level2","You wake up and blink. The bright light gets into your eyes and you shut them again. You lie comfortably but you are hungry.","get up;stand up","You try to stand up but you realise your legs are too weak.","none","none","open eyes","You feel like you want to see what you are doing. Maybe you should try opening your eyes again.","look for food; search for food;eat something;eat;eat food","You look around to see if there is any food. Suddenly a large glass barrel is emerging from somewhere and moves towards you. It's filled with a deliciously smelling liquid and has a soft opening at the front, almost like you could drink out of it. ","none","none","open eyes","You need to be able to see first!","open eyes;open my eyes","You open your eyes. There is bright light around you but it doesn't seem to hurt you anymore. After a couple of minutes you begin to make out shapes around you: It seems like you are in some sort of room. Lying on your back you can see the cream coloured ceiling. It looks smooth and lovely - much neater than what you are used to. There is something hanging off the ceiling with incredibly bright and beautiful colours. A warm light is coming from somewhere in the corner of the room. You still feel hungry.","none","none",,,"drink;drink liquid;suck;suck on opening;suck opening;drink from opening;drink from barrel;drink from glass barrel","You press your mouth onto it and the liquid emerges. It is warm, slightly sweet and very tasty. Probably the best thing you have ever drunk! After a few minutes of drinking you feel full and happy. Then a new tiredness overcomes you and you fall asleep again.","load","level3","look for food","You don't know what to drink. Maybe you should look for food first.","look at colourful thing;look at colourful object;look at object on ceiling;look at hanging thing;look at object;look at thing","You look at the colourful object hanging from the ceiling. It is mainly made from thin white strings has four shapes attached to it: a fiery red square, a bright green triangle, a deep blue circle and a shiny yellow star. They look incredibly exciting and beautiful. You can't take your eyes off them!","none","none","open eyes","You can't see anything as your eyes are closed.","look around;explore;explore room","It seems like you are in some sort of room. Lying on your back you can see the cream coloured ceiling. It looks smooth and lovely - much neater than what you are used to.

You still feel hungry.","none","none","open eyes","You need to open your eyes first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"level3","You wake up and open your eyes. They are now adjusting quite quickly to the light. You are still in the same room with the cream ceiling and the colourful construction above you. You wonder what else is there to discover.","look;look around;look around you;explore room;explore;discover;discover room","You look around a bit more. It seems you are in some sort of bed - it is very comfortable and there is a big, cosy blanket covering you. On the edge of a the bed there are tall wooden bars. You turn your head and see they are in fact all around your bed. You are trapped! Above you is that colourful construction hanging from the ceiling. If you reach up you might be able to touch it.","none","none",,,"get up;stand up;walk to bars;go to bars;go to edge of bed","You try to stand up, but realise that your legs are still really weak. In fact you can't even straighten them properly and certainly will not be able to use them to walk any time soon. Maybe you can move around in a different way though.","none","none",,,"touch wooden bars;touch bars;destroy bars;reach for bars;hit bars","You touch the wooden bars. They are solid wood. There is no way for you to get past them. Just as you touch them though, you hear voices. Suddenly two giant hands reach out for you over the top of the wooden bars and grab you! You scream! But then you realise you recognise the voices. They are friendly and kind voices. The hands pick you up and you fly through the air towards the owner of the hands - a giant! You can see his face now and he is smiling at you, holding you close and giving you a hug. He is talking but you can't quite understand what he is saying - he seems to be speaking in a strange language. Then you realise there is another giant next to the first one. This one is really beautiful and apparently a woman. Before you know it, you get passed over to her - she talks kindly to you and also gives you a warm hug. Her embrace feels cosy, soft and safe. She gently rocks you and you suddenly notice how tired you are once again. Serene and content you fall asleep in her arms.","load","end","move to bars","You are a bit too far away from the wooden bars that surround your bed.","move to bars;move to edge of bed;wriggle to edge of bed;wriggle to bars;crawl to bars;crawl to edge of bed;struggle to edge of bed;struggle to bars;writhe to bars;writhe to edge of bed;wreathe to edge of bed;wreathe to bars","You first try to turn onto your front to crawl, but are not strong enough. Then you realise you can wriggle your body sideways and actually manage to make some progress. After what seems like ages you reach the edge of the bed.","none","none",,,"touch construction;touch colourful thing;reach up;reach for construction;touch thing;reach for thing;touch object","You reach up and touch the colourful construction above. There is a a bright green triangle and a few other shapes hanging on some sort of silver thread. You manage to touch the triangle with your fingertips and cause it to swing to the side. All the other shapes seem to be connected to this one and you are amazed to see them all erupting in movement; turning swirling and spiralling in a cacophony of shapes and colours. You are absolutely enthralled by the beauty.","none","none",,,"get out of bed;leave bed;escape;run away","You can't use your legs to walk and there are the wooden bars in the way.","none","none",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
