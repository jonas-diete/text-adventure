# Text Adventure - Into The Light

This is a project to help me consolidate my C# skills.  

I am concentrating on writing neat high-quality code using OOP.

This will be a console application. It uses C# (.NET framework) and NUnit for testing.

I created an overview of my classes with Excalidraw to help me keep an overview of the different variables and methods and how everything links together.
